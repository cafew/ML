# Collection of functions to perform multi-classification. By default
# one-vs-all classification is used, however, any form of classification
# can be performed by specifiying the model matrix M. Please refer to
# the wikipedia article for a brief description of one-vs-all:

  #   wts:            List of weigths given to each column of the corresponding

  #   List containing tuples of accuracy and confusion matrix for each paramter combination.
