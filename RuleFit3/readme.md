### RuleFitScript

#### A collection of functions to assist in running the RuleFit3 package.

##### Requirements

 + Linux (might work on OSX, will **not** work on windows)

 + [RuleFit3](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~jhf/r-rulefit/rulefit3/RuleFit_help.html)

 + Python2.7 (Python 3.* should work as well)
 

##### Usage Notes

Please adjust the `platform` and `rfhome` paramters in `RuleFitScript.R`.
The easiest might be to copy the files `RuleFitScript.R` and `RuleFitRules.py` into the installation directory of RuleFit3 and source() `RuleFitScript.R`.
Please refer to the example file for a small how-to.
